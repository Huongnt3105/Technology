# Virtualization 

## Ảo hóa là gì?

Voltha aims to provide a layer of abstraction on top of legacy and next generation access network equipment for the purpose of control and management. Its initial focus is on PON (GPON, EPON, NG PON 2), but it aims to go beyond to eventually cover other access technologies (xDSL, Docsis, G.FAST, dedicated Ethernet, fixed wireless).

Key concepts of Voltha:

* **Network as a Switch**: It makes a set of connected access network devices to look like a(n abstract) programmable flow device, a L2/L3/L4 switch. Examples:
    * PON as a Switch
    * PON + access backhaul as a Switch
    * xDSL service as a Switch
* **Evolution to virtualization**: it can work with a variety of (access) network technologies and devices, including legacy, fully virtualized (in the sense of separation of hardware and software), and in between. Voltha can run on a decice, on general purpose servers in the central office, or in data centers.
* **Unified OAM abstraction**: it provides unified, vendor- and technology agnostic handling of device management tasks, such as service lifecycle, device lifecycle (including discovery, upgrade), system monitoring, alarms, troubleshooting, security, etc.
* **CloudDevOps bridge to modernization**: it does all above while also treating the abstracted network functions as software services manageable much like other software components in the cloud, i.e., containers.
